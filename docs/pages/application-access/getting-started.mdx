# Getting Started

Let's connect to a web application using Teleport Application Access. To do
that we will:

1. Install Teleport and connect it to a web application.
2. Create a Teleport user that has access to the application.
3. Access the application through Teleport.

## Prerequisites

* A web application you'd like to protect with App Access. If you don't have
  a web app, running Grafana in a [Docker container](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/docker/)
  is an easy way to try out the feature.
* Configured DNS records for the host where Teleport service will be running,
  are required to automatically fetch a Let's Encrypt certificate. For this
  guide we will assume your Teleport will be accessible at `teleport.example.com`
  and `*.teleport.example.com`.

## Step 1/3. Install and Configure Teleport

Download the latest version of Teleport for your platform from our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download).

Teleport requires a valid TLS certificate to operate and can fetch one automatically
using Let's Encrypt [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/) protocol.

As mentioned in prerequisites above, we will assume that you have configured DNS
records for `teleport.example.com` and `*.teleport.example.com` to point to the
node where you're launching Teleport.

Let's generate a Teleport config with ACME enabled:

```shell
$ teleport configure --cluster-name=teleport.example.com --acme --acme-email=alice@example.com > /tmp/teleport.yaml
```

<Admonition

  Teleport's ACME protocol integration currently requires web proxy to run on
  port 443.
</Admonition>

Now start Teleport and point it to your application endpoint:

```shell
$ sudo teleport start --config=/tmp/teleport.yaml \
  --roles=proxy,auth,app \
  --app-name=grafana \
  --app-uri=http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure to replace `--app-uri` with the actual endpoint your web application
is available at.

## Step 2/3. Create a Local User

Next we need to create a user that access to the application we've just
connected.

Teleport has a builtin role `access` that allows users to access cluster
resources. Create a local user assigned this role:

```sh
$ tctl users add --roles=access alice
```

The command will output a signup link. Use it to choose a password and setup
second factor. After that it will take you to the Teleport web UI.

## Step 3/3. Access the Application

There are a couple of ways to access the proxied application.

Every application is assigned a public address which you use to navigate to
the application directly. In our sample Grafana application we have provided a public address with
`--app-public-addr` flag so go to https://grafana.teleport.example.com
(replace with your app public address) to access the app. You will need to go
through Teleport auth screen if you're not logged into the Teleport web UI in
order to get to the application.

Alternatively, log into Teleport web UI at https://teleport.example.com
(replace with your proxy public address). All available applications are
displayed on the Applications tab. Click on the Grafana application tile
to access it.
